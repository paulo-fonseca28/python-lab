# python-lab

`python-lab` is a personal sandbox for learning and practicing **Python**.  
The goal of this repository is to centralize all my experiments, course exercises, and study projects in one place, so I can track my progress over time and show how I write and structure Python code.

This repo is not a single application, but a collection of independent folders (data science experiments, information‑retrieval prototypes, course material, etc.). Each subdirectory is self‑contained and can be explored on its own.

I created this repository to:

- Practice Python regularly, from fundamentals to more applied topics.
- Keep university work, online‑course exercises, and side projects organized.
- Build a public record of my evolution as a developer and data enthusiast.
- Have a place where recruiters and collaborators can quickly see real, working code.

You are welcome to explore the folders, run the scripts/notebooks, and use any ideas or snippets as reference.
