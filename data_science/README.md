# data_science

This folder is a small lab for **data science experiments in Python**.  
The goal here is to practice working with real datasets, implementing algorithms from scratch, and exploring typical workflows used in analytics and machine learning.

I created this directory to:

- Keep all my data‑science‑related notebooks and scripts in one place.
- Learn how to load, clean, and explore datasets using Python tools.
- Implement and understand classic algorithms beyond just calling library functions.
- Build a visible record of my progress in data analysis and machine learning.

Each subfolder inside `data_science` is an independent experiment or mini‑project, and can be opened and run on its own (usually through a Jupyter notebook or a simple Python script).
